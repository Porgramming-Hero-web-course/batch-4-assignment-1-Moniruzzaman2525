## 1. The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

TypeScript relies heavily on union and intersection types to allow for type-safe, expressive, and flexible programming. By modeling complex types and creating reusable, composable structures, they enable developers to increase codebase efficiency and dependability.

## Union Types:
A union type, indicated by the | operator, permits a variable to be one of multiple kinds. A value may be either a string or a number, for instance, if string | number is used.

## Syntax:
type Name = Type1 | Type2 | Type3

## Example:
Union types facilitate the handling of situations in which a value may be of more than one type by enabling a variable to represent numerous kinds. As an illustration:
let value : string | number;
value = 'Monir;
value = 42

type Status = "success" | "error" | "loading";

function handleStatus(status: Status) {
  if (status === "success") {
    console.log("Operation was successful.");
  } else if (status === "error") {
    console.log("An error occurred.");
  } else {
    console.log("Loading...");
  }
}

## Importance
Flexibility: Code may be adjusted to different inputs thanks to union types, which allow several types for a single variable.
Type Safety: To prevent errors, TypeScript makes sure that only types that are defined in the union can be allocated.
Narrowing: To make code safer and simpler to understand, TypeScript offers type narrowing, which infers the type within conditional branches.

## InterSection Type: 
An intersection type, represented by the & operator, needs a value to fulfill several types at once. Type A & B, for instance, indicates that an item must satisfy the requirements of both A and B.

## Syntax:
type Name = Type1 & Type2 & Type3;

## Example: 
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Employee {
  employeeId: number;
}

type EmployeePerson = Person & Employee;

const employee: EmployeePerson = {
  name: "Monir",
  employeeId: 520,
};

## Importance
Combining Structures: By combining preexisting kinds, intersection types enable you to construct more complicated types, which helps streamline the structuring of code.
Accurate Typing: Functions that must accept objects with numerous capabilities may benefit from intersection types, which guarantee that an object satisfies several criteria.
Code Reusability: Intersection types promote reusable types throughout the program and lessen redundancy by integrating smaller, more focused kinds.
